# Calculator Program

The Calculator Program, developed in Rust using the Solana blockchain framework, provides basic arithmetic functionalities such as addition and subtraction. Users can perform these operations, and the computed result is stored within a dedicated calculator account.

## Features

- Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers and updates the result.
- Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers and updates the result.

## Getting Started
